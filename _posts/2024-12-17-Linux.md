Description: How to get started with BBB and load image into board, set up cross-compile.


---
Firstly, most BBB have a built in 4GB SD card known as a eMMC. When the boards are made the eMMC is “flashed” with some version of the BeagleBone OS that is usually outdated. So the blog mainly guide about how to burn image via your external micro SDcard (with 4GB minium).

From your linux machine, install pre-built image for BBB version 4.14.108
``` 
wget https://files.beagle.cc/file/beagleboard-public-2021/images/bone-debian-9.12-imgtec-armhf-2020-04-06-4gb.img.xz
```
After that, extract the image to write into micro SDcard.
```
unxz bone-debian-9.12-imgtec-armhf-2020-04-06-4gb.img.xz
```
Write that extracted file into micro SDcard
```shell
sudo mkdir /media/usb
sudo dd if=/bone-debian-9.12-imgtec-armhf-2020-04-06-4gb.img of=/dev/sdb
sync
```
Hola, it's almost done. Now you can insert that sdcard into your board then insert the USB cable to power your board via computer. 
> When booting, you have to press and hold the boot button(S2) before you power the board then release the S2 button after 2 to 5 seconds. For further informations, you should take a look at this docs.

Now, we will set up the Host machine in order to cross-compile the BBB
First, let's install the packages that need to build Linux kernel.
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi git lzop u-boot-tools bison flex libssl-dev libncurses-dev sshfs lzma gettext libmpc-dev libncurses5-dev:amd64
```

then create a new directory called BBB
```shell
mkdir ~/BBB
cd ~/BBB
```
then clone the Linux kernel from Github and checkout to the kernel that BBB using. In this post, im going to build target the linux version 4.10
