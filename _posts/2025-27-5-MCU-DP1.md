<h3 id="Design Patterns in Embedded Systems" style="font-weight: bold;">Design Patterns in Embedded Systems</h3>
Embedded systems programming is both challenging and rewarding—especially when working with resource-constrained microcontrollers. One way to write scalable, maintainable, and robust firmware is by applying **design patterns** from software engineering. In this post, we'll introduce what design patterns are, their purpose in embedded development, and highlight common patterns with explanations tailored for C programmers.

<h3 id="What Are Design Patterns?" style="font-weight: bold;">What Are Design Patterns?</h3>
Design patterns are **proven solutions to recurring programming problems**. They provide templates for structuring code, making it easier to:
- **Reuse logic** across projects
- **Maintain and debug** firmware
- **Scale up** as features grow
- **Increase reliability**—critical in embedded applications

In resource-limited environments, good design is essential for efficiency and code clarity.

- **Resource Management:** Patterns help you use memory and peripherals wisely.
- **Hardware Abstraction:** Simplify hardware access and driver development.
- **Code Organization:** Enforce structure, making projects easier for teams.
- **Portability:** Make it easier to migrate code between different MCUs/platforms.

<h3 id="Categories & Common Patterns" style="font-weight: bold;">Categories & Common Patterns</h3>

<h4>Creational Patterns</h4>
<p>These patterns deal with object creation and resource management.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Pattern</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Factory Method</td><td>Provides an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. Useful for sensor/driver abstraction.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Object Method</td><td>Encapsulates data and related functions, simulating object-oriented behavior in C.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Opaque Method</td><td>Hides implementation details, exposing only handles and function pointers (common in driver APIs).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Singleton Method</td><td>Ensures only one instance of a peripheral or resource exists in the system.</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Structural Patterns</h4>
<p>These patterns help organize code and interfaces.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Pattern</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Callback Method</td><td>Uses function pointers for event-driven programming (e.g., ISR handlers).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Inheritance Method</td><td>Simulates inheritance using structured data and function pointers.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Virtual API Method</td><td>Uses function pointers in structs to allow runtime selection of API implementations (e.g., different communication protocols).</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Behavioral Concurrency Patterns</h4>
<p>These patterns focus on interactions and synchronization.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Pattern</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Bridge Method</td><td>Decouples abstraction from implementation; allows hardware/software separation.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Concurrency Method</td><td>Manages multiple tasks/threads, often with RTOS or custom schedulers.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Spinlock Method</td><td>Implements busy-waiting for resource access in real-time contexts.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Mutex Method</td><td>Mutual exclusion for shared resources in concurrent environments.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Conditional Method</td><td>Synchronizes threads/tasks using flags or condition variables.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Behavioral Method</td><td>Encapsulates algorithms/behaviors, allowing independent changes.</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


<h3 id="Summary" style="font-weight: bold;">Summary</h3>

Design patterns aren't just for desktop or web software—they're invaluable in embedded systems as well. Whether you're building firmware for any microcontroller, patterns like Singleton, Factory, Callback, and others help you write better, safer, and more maintainable code.
