<h3 id="Introduction" style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</h3>
Recently, I have been working with systems that require analyzing CAN (Controller Area Network) information. Since I needed to test CAN communication before our custom PCB is ready, I purchased a PEAK PCAN-USB adapter for development (PCAN (PEAK CAN) adapters are widely used for interfacing with CAN buses in automotive and industrial embedded systems.). However, I found that much of the available documentation is either in Chinese or somewhat confusing. This guide summarizes the process I followed to install and use the PCAN hardware and tools on Ubuntu Linux. It is intended to help others who might face similar challenges, providing clear, step-by-step instructions in English.

<h3 id="Install-Required-Libraries" style="font-weight: bold;"> Install Required Libraries</h3>

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libpopt-dev make make-guile gcc g++
```

<h3 id="Install-PCAN-Driver" style="font-weight: bold;"> Install PCAN Driver</h3>
The link to the pcan driver: 
[PCAN-Driver](/assets/files/PCAN/peak-linux-driver-8.15.2.tar.gz)
1. Download the PEAK Linux driver:

   ```sh
   tar xvf peak-linux-driver-8.15.2.tar.gz
   cd peak-linux-driver-8.15.2/
   ```

2. Build and install the driver:

   ```sh
   make clean
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

3. Connect the PCAN-USB adapter. To verify the driver and device:

   ```sh
   pcaninfo
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   PCAN driver version: 8.15.2
   PCAN-Basic version: 4.6.2.36
   * pcanusb32: "PCAN_USBBUS1" (0x051), PCAN-USB #1, devid=0x00 (/sys/class/pcan/pcanusb32)
   ```

<h3 id="Install-PCANView" style="font-weight: bold;"> (Optional) Install pcanview (CAN Bus Viewer)</h3>

1. Add PEAK-System's APT repository:

   ```sh
   wget -q http://www.peak-system.com/debian/dists/$(lsb_release -cs)/peak-system.list -O- | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/peak-system.list
   wget -q http://www.peak-system.com/debian/peak-system-public-key.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. Install pcanview-ncurses:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install pcanview-ncurses
   ```

3. Run pcanview:

   ```sh
   pcanview
   ```

<h3 id="Testing-with-can-utils" style="font-weight: bold;"> (Optional) Testing with can-utils</h3>

Install can-utils:

```sh
sudo apt-get install can-utils
```

Example usage:

```sh
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000   # Set bitrate to 500k
sudo ifconfig can0 up                           # Bring CAN interface up
cansend can0 999#DEADBEEF                       # Send CAN frame with ID 0x999 and data 0xDEADBEEF
candump can0                                    # Listen for CAN frames
sudo ifconfig can0 down                         # Bring CAN interface down
```

<h3 id="Kernel-Configuration" style="font-weight: bold;"> Notes on Kernel Configuration (Embedded Linux)</h3>

If you are using an embedded ARM/ARM64 board, ensure your Linux kernel has CAN and PEAK USB CAN support enabled:

- In kernel menuconfig:

  ```
  Networking support  --->
    CAN bus subsystem support  --->
      CAN Device Drivers  --->
        CAN USB interfaces  --->
          <*> PEAK PCAN-USB/USB Pro interfaces for CAN 2.0b/CAN-FD
  ```

- After connecting the device, you should see a `can0` interface:

  ```
  ifconfig -a
  ```
